# Bot.ex

Hello! This is a readme file to a discord bot which goes by the name of BOT.Ex . This bot as of now can be used to display motivational quotes and also has the feature to send in cheerful messages when ever someone sends a sad message on the server to cheer up the user .

Tools i used to make this bot are -
  - Replit
  - Uptimerobot
  - Zenquotes.io
  
  REPLIT -
    Repl.it is a free IDE (integrated development environment) that allows users to write their own programs and code in dozens of different languages. I used this as its easy to use and saves alot of time which would have been instead wasted in precoding setups. With its easy to use gui and a feature to hide the sensitive information makes it a perfect tool for making a discord bot from it .
    
  UPTIMEROBOT - 
    UptimeRobot has an easy-to-use API. Responses are provided as XML, JSON or JSON-P. It lets you get the details of your monitors, logs, create / edit / delete monitors, alert contacts and maintenance windows.
    This was used in the process of keeping the bot in active or always online state even when the tab (containing the code present in replit) is closed .
   
  ZENQUOTES.IO -
    In order to get the motivational quotes for the bot , this website was used as it was just the right choice for the task that the bot was performing.
  
\\Future plans - I wish to integrate music and meme features to it aswell ,in order to make it the centre of attention in a particular discord server and make it easier for the server admins to only install a single bot that can perform all the basic yet important tasks.
